## üêç BashTUI.py: Python Interface for Bash dialog Checklist
This script, BashTUI.py, demonstrates how to utilize the powerful dialog utility from the Bash environment within a Python script to create a simple Text User Interface (TUI) checklist.

It allows a user to make multiple selections from a defined list of options, capturing the choices back into the Python environment for further processing.

Feature Selection: Allows users to select multiple features/options.

Result Capture: Captures the selected options and prints them to the console.

Error Handling: Manages cases where the user cancels the dialog.

Temporary File Management: Uses a temporary file (/tmp/checklist_choices.txt) to capture dialog's output, and ensures it's removed afterward.
